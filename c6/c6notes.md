## Math and Logic Puzzles

### Prime Numbers
Every positive integers can be decomposed into a product of primes.
  `84 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1 * 11^0 * 13^0 * 17^0 ...`

#### Divisibility
The prime number law stated above means that, in order for a number X to divide a number Y, all primes in X's prime factorization must be Y's prime factorization. Or, more specifically:

  `
  Let x = 2^j0 * 3^j1 * 5^j2 * 7^j3 * 11^j4 * ...
  Let y = 2^k0 * 3^k1 * 5^k2 * 7^k3 * 11^k4 * ...
  If x/y, then for all i, ji <= ki
  `
